## Usage

### Setup
Several non-standard libaries are required to support threaded HTTP requests and dns lookups. You'll need to install the requirements as follows:

```sh
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Running
The only required argument is at least one keyword. You can use the built-in fuzzing strings, but you will get better results if you supply your own with `-m` and/or `-b`.

You can provide multiple keywords by specifying the `-k` argument multiple times.

Keywords are mutated automatically using strings from `enum_tools/fuzz.txt` or a file you provide with the `-m` flag. Services that require a second-level of brute forcing (Azure Containers and GCP Functions) will also use `fuzz.txt` by default or a file you provide with the `-b` flag.

Let's say you were researching "somecompany" whose website is "somecompany.io" that makes a product called "blockchaindoohickey". You could run the tool like this:

```sh
./cloud_enum.py -k somecompany -k somecompany.io -k blockchaindoohickey
```

HTTP scraping and DNS lookups use 5 threads each by default. You can try increasing this, but eventually the cloud providers will rate limit you. Here is an example to increase to 10.

```sh
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword -t 10
```

For detailed output showing enumeration methodology and FQDN formats, use the verbose flag:

```sh
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword -v
```

### Advanced Usage

**Service Selection**: You can target specific cloud services instead of running all checks:

```sh
# AWS specific services
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword --aws-services s3,lambda,elb

# Azure specific services  
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword --azure-services storage-accounts,websites,databases,container-registry,iot-hub

# GCP specific services
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword --gcp-services gcp-buckets,app-engine,cloud-functions

# Mixed cloud targeting
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword --aws-services s3,cloudfront --azure-services storage-accounts,container-registry --gcp-services gcp-buckets
```

**Region Filtering**: You can limit scans to specific regions for faster, targeted enumeration:

```sh
# AWS regions
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword --aws-regions us-east-1,us-west-2,eu-west-1

# Azure regions
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword --azure-regions eastus,westus2,northeurope

# GCP regions (especially useful for Cloud Functions)
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword --gcp-regions us-central1,europe-west1,asia-east1

# Combined region and service filtering
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword --aws-services rds --aws-regions us-east-1,us-west-2
./cloud_enum.py -k keyword --gcp-services cloud-functions --gcp-regions us-central1,us-east1
```

**Discovery Commands**: Use these to see what services and regions are available:

```sh
# Show all available services (now includes 24+ Azure services)
./cloud_enum.py --show-services

# Show all available regions
./cloud_enum.py --show-regions
```

**Important Notes**: 
- Some resources (RDS, Redshift, Azure Containers, GCP Functions, Cloud SQL, Spanner) are discovered per-region. 
- RDS and Redshift use region-specific FQDNs: `instance.region.rds.amazonaws.com`
- GCP region-specific services use: `resource.region.googleapis.com` (Cloud SQL, Spanner)
- Cloud Functions use: `region-projectname.cloudfunctions.net`
- BigQuery and Pub/Sub are region-aware but don't include region in URL format
- The tool will validate your region/service selections and warn about invalid entries.
- Region filtering is most beneficial for RDS, Redshift, GCP Cloud Functions/SQL/Spanner, and Azure Virtual Machines.
- Use `--quickscan` to disable mutations and second-level scanning for faster results.
